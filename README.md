# Baseball-Stats
## Description
A collection of files that I use to analyse a baseball teams performance.

The files so far only cover basic statistics, essentially on batting average and plotting a cumulative batting average for all players. The next bit of functionality to develop will be to be able to specify indiviual players. At the moment the whole team is displayed.

## Planned Functionality
* Calculate baseball statistics for a given (possibly more than 1?)
* Display team statistics <- provide list
* Display both team and individual statistics
* Provide team and individual reports (need to look to see if there are any python libraries that may be able to help)
* Develop a transition matrix and see how that is developed. It may not be useful at the local level, but it will be good as an exercise.
* Develop some metrics for the league for comparison.

## Todo List
- [x] Breakup file into separate files. Suggestions:
- [ ] File for inputs, outputs, and printing
- [ ] File for cleaning data
- [ ] File for calculating with and processing data
- [x] Convert to snake case
- [x] Git
- [ ] Setup stat DF
- [ ] Create output file
- [x] Type error with line 173
- [x] Add legend with names
- [ ] Cut down on the imports

## Data Reporting Libraries
Below are a list of potential
